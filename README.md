# code-paper-recurrent

## Introduction

This is a folder to save some code to recurrent some algorithm in some papers.  
Then I will introduce these algorithm:  
1. **[MLHM]** = multiscale local homogeneity measure  
[[REF] Nie J, Qu S, Wei Y, et al. An infrared small target detection method based on multiscale local homogeneity measure[J]. Infrared Physics & Technology, 2018, 90: 186-194.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350449517305078)
2. **[LSK]** = local steering kernel  
[[REF] Li Y, Zhang Y. Robust infrared small target detection using local steering kernel reconstruction[J]. Pattern Recognition, 2018, 77: 113-125.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320317304983)
## Purpose

This is a storehouse to store some runnable codes about some algorithms.  
I will upgrade the storehouse when I have some free time or have some new codes, but not periodically. So please don't push the author !!!

[Tips] the algorithm codes in this folder are written by myself, but I will use some function from some toolbox. Thanks for predecessor!!

## Language

MATLAB (currently)  
C++    (future)

## History
2018-10-17 upgraded LSK and MLHM algorithm.
