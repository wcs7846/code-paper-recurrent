# code-paper-recurrent

## Introduction

This is a folder to save some code to recurrent some algorithm in some papers.
Then I will introduce these algorithm:
1.[MLHM] = multiscale local homogeneity measure 
(REF) An infrared small target detection method based on multiscale local homogeneity measure

2.[LSK] = local steering kernel
(REF) Robust infrared small target detection using local steering kernel reconstruction
## Purpose

This is a storehouse to store some runnable codes about some algorithms.
I will upgrade the storehouse when I have some free time or have some new codes, but not periodically. So please don't push the author !!!

[Tips] the algorithm codes in this folder are written by myself, but I will use some function from some toolbox. Thanks for predecessor!!

## Language

MATLAB (currently)
C++    (future)

## History
2018-10-17 upgraded LSK and MLHM algorithm.
